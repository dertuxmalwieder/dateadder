# dateadder

Fulfills the single need of having a platform-independent tool that lets me, the developer, add days, weeks or even months to today's (or any other) date and see the resulting date.

* Does not support units smaller than a day. Feel free to fork this project and make a `houradder` or something.
* Also does not support substracting days, weeks or even months. Feel free to fork this project and make a `datesubstracter` or something.

Posted here for your convenience.

## Examples

    % ./dateadder "today in a week"
    % ./dateadder "2021/12/31 plus four days"

Et cetera, et cetera.
